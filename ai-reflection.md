# AI Use & Reflection

- I used the AI assistant to scaffold components and pages, plus suggested ISR strategy.
- Corrections made: added Layout wrapper, image fallbacks, and fixed imports (Link in `Card`).
- Verification: Code inspected and files created; please run `npm run dev` locally to visually verify responsive behavior.
- Where AI could improve: suggest more semantic HTML and accessibility attributes; also adding unit tests would be helpful.
